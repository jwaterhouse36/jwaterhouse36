Hello,

My name is Josh Waterhouse and this is my github.

As of now this is my storage for projects as I develop my data analyst portfolio.

I am a recent graduate from Portland State University with a B.S. in Economics.

Currently I am learning how to use Python and SQL for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

I am interested in bowling, video games, and bass guitar. 

Come check out my work and see how it continues to develop.

Thank You!
