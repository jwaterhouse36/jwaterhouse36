Hello,

My name is Josh Waterhouse and this is my github.

As of now this is my storage for projects as I develop my software developer portfolio.

I am a recent graduate from Portland State University with a B.S. in Economics.

Currently I am learning backend development in Kotlin. I have had some moderate exposure to other languages such as Java, Go, and Python.

I am interested in bowling, video games, and bass guitar. 

Come check out my work and see how it continues to develop.

Thank You!
